AhYasse: command

GitHub Copilot: Here are the steps to create a new React portfolio project:

1. First, create a new React project using Create React App with TypeScript:
```bash
npx create-react-app react-portfolio --template typescript
cd react-portfolio
```

2. Install additional dependencies you might need:
```bash
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled react-router-dom framer-motion
```

3. Create the basic folder structure:
```bash
mkdir -p src/{components,assets/styles,types}
```

4. Update your package.json with the latest dependencies:
````json
{
  "name": "react-portfolio",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "@emotion/react": "^11.11.0",
    "@emotion/styled": "^11.11.0",
    "@mui/material": "^5.13.0",
    "framer-motion": "^10.12.0",
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
    "react-router-dom": "^6.11.0",
    "react-scripts": "5.0.1",
    "typescript": "^4.9.5"
  },
  // ...existing code...
}
````

5. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

The project will be available at http://localhost:3000. You can now start building your portfolio components in the `src/components` directory.

AhYasse: delete package command

GitHub Copilot: To delete the package.json and all installed dependencies, you can use these commands in the terminal:

```bash
# Remove node_modules directory
rm -rf node_modules

# Remove package-lock.json
rm package-lock.json

# Remove package.json
rm package.json
```

After this, you'll have a clean slate to start your React project from scratch. Make sure you're in the correct directory (MyPortifolio) when running these commands.

AhYasse: delete  command ncu

GitHub Copilot: To check and update package versions using `ncu` (npm-check-updates), first uninstall it if you have it:

```bash
npm uninstall -g npm-check-updates
```

Or if you prefer using npx to remove it:

```bash
npx npm-check-updates uninstall
```

Then remove any references to it from your scripts section in package.json if they exist.

You can also verify it's removed by running:

```bash
which ncu
```

This should return nothing if successfully removed.
